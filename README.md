# VideoSite
An HTML5 website built in 2014 using PHP, HTML5, and Javascript that allows users to upload and watch videos.  Remains unfinished, but includes a fully functioning login and upload system.

This site was a test project that I made.  I wanted to try building a content management system from scratch.  The login system was built from scratch, and was modified for use in a future project.
